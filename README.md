# Recon
A collection of reconnaissance tools.

No matter the who it is: Advanced Persistent Threat (APT), in-house security staff, cyber researchers or contracted pentesting organisations the first thing any threat actor must accomplish is in depth reconnaissance.Â 
MITRE ATT&CK breaks this down into discrete tasks which can also be used to red team cyber threats or wargame a cyber attack against your own networks.

This repo is used as a store to collate a number of simple but effective scripts and tools (sources annotated if not made by myself) to assist in this key intelligence gathering stage of cyber operations.
